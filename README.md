#### CONTEXT: This was my semester project for an undergraduate data visualization class.

#### REASONING: Kiva is a non-profit that allows small lenders in developed countries to lend directly to entrepreneurs in developing countries.

#### New Kiva users may face choice overload when attempting to find a suitable entrepreneur.  KivaExplore aims to help users narrow down their list of potential entrepreneurs.

#### CONTRIBUTING: I plan to deploy this app to Heroku and will provide contribution instructions upon deployment.

#### INSTRUCTIONS:

#### To run this app locally, clone the repository first.  Then, in the project-level directory, type:

```
python app.py
```

#### This should get the app going.  Please note that some errors may occur because I haven't added images/wordclouds for some of the countries.  As of now, the only countries with images and wordclouds are Afghanistan, Armenia, Albania, Mali, and Yemen.

## Data is sourced from Kiva and is not owned by me.

### Feel free to message me if you have any questions!
